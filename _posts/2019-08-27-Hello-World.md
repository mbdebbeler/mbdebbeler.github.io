Reporting live from day two of my apprenticeship! I spent this morning configuring my terminal, setting up this blog, and working through vimtutor. I'm going to go finish vimtutor and then attempt to update this post using vim.

UPDATE: I have successfully opened, edited, and saved this post with Vim. ~image of Meryl Streep with the pink laptop in She-Devil~
